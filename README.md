## Introdution
Buddhism says that we should be skeptical of our feelings. They are not necessarily truthful guides to reality and indeed that we should be skeptical of some of the thoughts and the perceptions that feelings foster.

## Lecture 1: The First Two Noble Truths
1. song: Mick Jagger of Rolling Stones: I can't get no satisfaction.    

**Languages** | **Sanskrit** | **Pali**
--- | --- | ---
`(苦)` | `Duhkha` | `Dukkha`
`(涅槃)` | `Nivvana` | `Nibbana`
`(法)` | `Dharma` | `Dhamma`
*empty* | **nicely** | **nicely**

    Dharma: (unseen order)    
Probably the most common meaning of dharma is to refer to the Buddha's teachings and by extension, the path that the Buddha said we should tread.   


    Nivvana(supreme good)     
if, again, we, we make it all the way through the, the Four Noble Truths and follow them, and their implications, precisely which Brings us back to duhkka     

    Duhka(unsatisfactoriness in life)  

#### First Noble:    
The existence of suffering:Life is suffering.


So, just to give you an example, let's take one of my favorite things; powdered sugar donuts. Okay, I don't eat them all that often, I'm proud to say, but that does sometimes takes some self restraint, you know. I'm talking about, you may have see them, in these little 6 packs of donuts at a convenience store, each one small enough to pop into your mouth. And if you asked me, while I'm eating one of these, am I suffering? The answer is, I would say no, are you kidding, obviously not. I'm not suffering. On the other hand, it probably is true that, you know, just about as soon as I start swallowing the one donut, I'm already thinking about that next donut, already kind of yearning for another donut at some level.
8:47
And the fact that I want another donut means that in a literal sense, I didn't get satisfaction. If you get satisfaction, you don't want any more. Right?

Impermanence is a very common word in Buddhist texts. The idea is that you know, nothing is permanent in the world, certainly not pleasure, and yet we seem to try to cling to things

#### Second Noble:(the cause of suffering)   
The cause of suffering:
thirst, craving, clinging.    
in clinging to things that won't last.Psychologists refer to this as the Hedonic Treadmill.

Truth of suffering:

## Lecture 2: The Last Two Noble Truth

#### Third Noble（寂灭）: The cessation of suffering (Nirodha)

the first two noble truths the bad news and good news    

The third noble truth tells us what the cure is. It is the abandonment of craving and of clinging.

#### Fourth Noble: The Eightfold Path (Magga道谛)
The fourth noble truth spells out the path you have to follow if you're going to attain full liberation

#### Meditation:

Shinzen Young a good meditation teacher.


mindfulness is attention that functions in an atmosphere of detachment. It's attention that aspires towards a pure objectivity, an awareness which reflects the nature of objects exactly as they are, without adding to them, without elaborating upon them, without interpreting through the screens of subjective evaluation and commentary -- Bhikkhu Bodhi


The idea is that the mind as it ordinarily works and is designed to work is not a reliable instrument of perception and of thought.


#### Mindfulness Meditation and the Brain

The idea of mindfulness. is to take an objective attitude. In some sense the detached attitude toward the things you're paying attention to and yet your brain is designed to pay attention to those things it is hardest to be objective and detached about.


So here's an experiment you might try when you're walking down the street. Try to pay attention to things that you don't normally pay attention to. Now what those things are will depend on what demographic you're in. So suppose you're a young heterosexual male. And you're probably in the habit of paying attention to young females and especially if you find them attractive or intriguing, paying even more attention to them, and you probably pay some attention to young males. kind of size them up, compare them to yourself maybe they are after all in some sense the competition. Well, try paying attention to like elderly people.


So we're going to close by revisiting our friend Yife, the Buddhist nun as she describes what it's like to meditate, because her description sounds to me very much like what you would expect it to feel like for the default mode network to start to quiet down. >> When you meditate it, it's just like there will watch, you know, in the water, if you let the dust just settle down. So water become maybe clean and also very peaceful. >> Mm hmm. >> Or even stilled. So you've heard the water's still. The surface like a mirror and you would reflect the surrounding as things they are. So meditation is a help, is to help us to see things as they really are. >> Speaking of Yife, in the final segment of this lecture we're going to get back to a question that she originally raised earlier. When she said that, during meditation, she gets this sense that her feelings are not real.


#### Can Our Feelings Be Trusted?
