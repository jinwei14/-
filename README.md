## Introdution
Buddhism says that we should be skeptical of our feelings. They are not necessarily truthful guides to reality and indeed that we should be skeptical of some of the thoughts and the perceptions that feelings foster.

So, just to give you an example, let's take one of my favorite things; powdered sugar donuts. Okay, I don't eat them all that often, I'm proud to say, but that does sometimes takes some self restraint, you know. I'm talking about, you may have see them, in these little 6 packs of donuts at a convenience store, each one small enough to pop into your mouth. And if you asked me, while I'm eating one of these, am I suffering? The answer is, I would say no, are you kidding, obviously not. I'm not suffering. On the other hand, it probably is true that, you know, just about as soon as I start swallowing the one donut, I'm already thinking about that next donut, already kind of yearning for another donut at some level.

Impermanence is a very common word in Buddhist texts. The idea is that you know, nothing is permanent in the world, certainly not pleasure, and yet we seem to try to cling to things

#### Second Noble:(the cause of suffering)   
thirst, craving, clinging.    
in clinging to things that won't last.Psychologists refer to this as the Hedonic Treadmill.

Truth of suffering:
